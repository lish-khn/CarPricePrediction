# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Linear Regression

This project is focused on predicting car prices based on various car features using **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and a **Linear Regression** model from the `scikit-learn` library.

## 📊 Overview

The aim is to build a regression model that predicts the price of a car using features such as mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine capacity, and more. The process includes:

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Model training using Linear Regression
- Performance evaluation and interpretation

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook


## 🔍 Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values and duplicates
- Encoded categorical features
- Removed irrelevant or redundant columns

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualized distributions and relationships between variables
- Identified outliers and strong correlations with car price
- Highlighted key influencing features

### 3. Model Building
- Trained a **Linear Regression** model using Scikit-learn
- Performed train-test split
- Evaluated performance using metrics like:
  - R² Score
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

### 4. Results
- Interpreted model coefficients
- Found the most impactful features on car prices
- Achieved a decent baseline prediction accuracy

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- Try more advanced models (Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Build a web interface using Streamlit or Flask
- Deploy the model
